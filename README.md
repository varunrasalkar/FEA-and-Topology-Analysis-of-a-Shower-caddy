# FEA-and-Topology-Analysis-of-a-Shower-caddy
## The single part geometry of Shower caddy was designed in Solid Edge with two family of parts: A. With 3 holes and B. 2 hooks 
## FEA and Topology Analysis was done in Altairâ€™s HyperMesh in Optistruct.
## Forces were applied at three different scenarios and based on the study it was found that shower caddy with 3 holes withstood stresses in more efficiently.
