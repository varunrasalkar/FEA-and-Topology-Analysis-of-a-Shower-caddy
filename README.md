# FEA_and_Topology_Analysis_of_a_Shower_caddy
## The single part geometry of Shower caddy was designed in Solid Edge with two family of parts: A. With 3 holes and B. 2 hooks 
## FEA and Topology Analysis was done in Altair’s HyperMesh in Optistruct.
## Forces were applied at three different scenarios and based on the study it was found that shower caddy with 3 holes withstood stresses in more efficiently.
